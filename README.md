# JavaBook
1. Create a new Project and call it JavaBook
Inside
the src folder, create a package and give it a name ( Remember the naming
convention!)
Inside
the package, create your main Class and name it JavaBook (the class which
has a main method)
Then
create another class and call it “Book”
Open
Book Class and add: a few “states” (instance variables aka fields) and behaviors
(methods)
create
a constructor which initializes the instance variables
Back
in the main class, create a few book objects and give each one of them states,
and display all of their “behaviors” in the console.
2. Still inside your JavaBook project, create:
setters
and getters
create
a function which will call your getter methods and print out it’s values to the
console
